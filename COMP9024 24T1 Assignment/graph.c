// You have been provided with a file graph.h. Examine the file carefully. It provides the interface for an ADT that will provide Graph functionality. The graph is both weighted and directed.

// Your task is to implement the functions prototyped in the graph.h header file within graph.c.

// You must create the file graph.c to implement this ADT.
// You must use an adjacency list representation, but the exact representation is up to you.
// You must use string (char *) data to label the vertices.
// You must allocate memory dynamically.
// You must not modify the graph.h file.
// You must not modify the function prototypes declared in the graph.h file.
// You may add utility functions to the graph.c file.
// You may use the string.h library, and other standard libraries from the weekly exercises.
// You may reuse code previously submitted for weekly assessments and provided in the lectures.
// You should write programs that use your ADT to test and debug your code.
// You should use valgrind to verify that your ADT does not leak memory.
// See graph.h for more information about each function that you are required to implement.
