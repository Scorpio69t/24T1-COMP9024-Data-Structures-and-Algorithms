// You have been provided with a file list.h. Examine the file carefully. It provides the interface for an ADT that will provide Queue, Stack, and Set functionality.

// Your task is to implement the functions prototyped in the list.h header file within list.c.

// You must create the file list.c to implement this ADT.
// You must store string (char *) data within the ADT.
// You must allocate memory dynamically.
// You must not modify the list.h file.
// You must not modify the function prototypes declared in the list.h file.
// You may add utility functions to the list.c file.
// You may use the string.h library, and other standard libraries from the weekly exercises.
// You may reuse code previously submitted for weekly assessments and provided in the lectures.
// You may use whatever internal representation you like for your list ADT, provided it does not contradict any of the above.
// You may assume that any instance of your list ADT will only be used as a queue or a stack or a set.
// You should write programs that use your ADT to test and debug your code.
// You should use valgrind to verify that your ADT does not leak memory.
// As a reminder:

// Queue - First In, First Out
// Stack - First In, Last Out
// Set - Only stores unique values.
// See list.h for more information about each function that you are required to implement.
