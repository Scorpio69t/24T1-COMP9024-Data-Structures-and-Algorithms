A word is a palindrome if its reverse is equal to itself. 
For example, ABBA is a palindrome, whereas ABCA is not. 
One way of representing a word in a computer is to have a singly-linked list, 
where we have a list element for each letter.

// Create an empty linked list 
// Loop through list and add each element to the head of the list 


MAIN [A] [B] [B] [B]

traverse for N / 2

REP = [B] [A] 

second half N / 2 --> End

Check if MAIN[i] == REP[j] 

assumption: size of word is known
